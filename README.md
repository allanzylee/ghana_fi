Abstract: Food insecurity (“FI”) is associated with poorer child academic achievement and socioemotional skills across
various contexts. However, existing evidence relies on caregiver reports of household FI, overlooking children's own lived
experiences. Further, it often ignores low- and middle-income countries (“LMICs”), where experiences of FI can be the
highest, and neglects heterogeneity in the relation between FI and child skills by sex and age. We address these gaps by
investigating the relations between caregiver-reported household-level and child-reported child-level FI and child cognitive
and socioemotional skills for a sample of 2,587 rural parents and 3,985 children in five northern Ghanaian regions. We tackle
endogeneity concerns by relying on value-added methods. Results indicate that caregiver-reported household FI predicts
lower value added to literacy and numeracy by approximately 0.1 standard deviations. We found no evidence of heterogeneity
by child sex but negative and significant effects by age for caregiver-reported FI, indicating older children are more negatively
affected by FI.
